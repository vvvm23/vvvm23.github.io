I've had a hankering for a while to completely redo my personal website. There
are a number of reasons for this.

For one, the old site was generated using my own static site generator
[sss](https://github.com/vvvm23/sss). This was more of a project to learn Rust,
rather to build a good static site generator. As such, it has not stood the
test of time. Most notably, adding new features is truly awful and the HTML
templates are part of the source code, rather than being separate and thus
easily customisable. I'm not interested enough in web development to invest
a lot of time in refactoring the generator. Basically, a serious case of code
smell.

Hence, this time I'm using an "off-the-open-source" shelf solution
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which actually was quite a lot of work too. Not
because Hugo is hard to use, but finding a template that I liked both
aesthetically and functionally was tricky. I must have about ten
different repos on my computer from trying themes, writing some
content, before discarding it entirely. 

A surprising issue was finding a theme I liked, but when I started writing
content, it didn't feel like "mine" - more like the theme author's site. It is
somewhat illogical (as the one I settled on is also not mine) but at least my
original site was all mine, even if it was the dictionary definition of
"graphic design is (not) my passion". I settled on the
[PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/) theme, used in my
favourite blog [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/).

Another reason to nuke the old site was that I had a number of old posts that
didn't meet my current standards - even having errors in them. This is an issue
with the human condition more than anything: learning more exposes what we
didn't previously know. No doubt this will continue, but I should endeavour in
the future to not delete too much.

For posterity's sake, my old site looked like this:

> A certain charm to it, but undeniably jank under the surface.

Redoing my personal website is the first piece of work I have done since
completing all my university coursework and exams, marking the end of the most
stressful period of my life, and marking the start of doing things I have been
putting off. I'll be starting my first job in September, so I'm hoping a clear
delineation between time spent on work responsibilities and time for everything
else will allow for, well, more "other things" (such as writing here) than
I had when I was a student. I can only hope that, in a years time, the previous
sentence is deathly accurate and not horribly na√Øve.
