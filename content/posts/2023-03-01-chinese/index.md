 >- Conclusion

About thirteen years ago, for absolutely no reason, Alex tried learning
Japanese. This lasted about a week, then unceremoniously stopped.

About five years ago, because Alex thought the alphabet was cool, Alex tried
learning Korean. He learnt the alphabet, then realised he (A) knew no Korean
people (B) never consumed any media in Korean.

Then about four years ago, also for no reason, Alex tried learning Chinese.
Which began this on-and-off adventure into language learning I've been having
since then.

<!-- TODO: I want this part to be good but can't express myself well now -->
Although I market myself as a tech person, I do like talking about my other
hobbies. I feel exploring areas you are totally unfamiliar with is quite a good
thing to do. For example, I've always been interested in computers, so some
things feel almost like second-nature to me. On the other hand, language
education in the UK is extremely lackluster so I had next to no experience
here. Starting from nothing is a huge struggle but is also an amazingly rich
experience. I am unsure how to eloquently explain this, but you just touch
areas of knowledge that you would never if you had stuck in more familiar
areas. Even if your area is very deep and rich and you could never really
master it all, jumping to an entirely different thing is something I can't
recommend enough. I've learnt so much about memory, habits, consistency,
language (amazing) to name a few, that have fed directly back into other facets
of life. I can't really stress this enough, in retrospect I think I would have
even just enjoyed studying languages formally during undergraduate. I just
hadn't explored that path when I was making university decisions.

It has been so impactful on my early adult life, that I feel the need to write
about it. However, the path I took (and probably still taking) is far from the
ideal, optimal, or efficient path. I made a lot of pretty huge mistakes along
the way that have delayed me. Hence, despite studying on-and-off so long, I am
really nowhere near fluent or even conversational. I had huge periods of
intense study that were fundamentally flawed, along with periods of no work.
This is a natural consequence of embracing the fool's journey in an unfamiliar
area, however the result is finding a nice method that seemingly works for me.
This is the method I have been following for the past 300 days or so and
reached levels I hadn't attained previously. However, when reading about what I do now, please keep in mind the years of floundering about giving me an unstable foundation - but a foundation nonetheless.

This post is split up into parts. First, I will cover the foundations I learnt and why it didn't really work out for me. Next, I will cover what my current method is that began roughly 300 days ago. After that, I will analyse how the method has faired. Finally, I will discuss where I am going next to reach my ultimate goals.

I've played around with so many different methods which I will reference where
my memory serves me. However, I am most influenced by
[Livakivi](https://www.youtube.com/c/livakivi), my favourite Youtuber who
simply shares what he has been learning in a very captivating way, be it art,
technology, renovating a Soviet-era store, or most famously: Japanese language
learning. If you are interested in language learning - or learning in general - all his content is very good. His attitude embodies what I want to discuss here: just starting, keeping at it, and finding out what works for you.

Without further ado.

## How I started

Like I said, the early beginnings were quite scattershot in nature. If I recall
correctly, I began by playing with apps (not Duolingo, as support at the time
was just straight-up broken) and a couple random textbooks, along with a decent
dictionary app named Pleco - which I still use to this day. Although the process
was a bit random, it gave me a foundational understanding of grammar and simple
phrases.

<!-- TODO: add text book, integrated and that weird old one -->
I dislike studying grammar and textbook work in general, however I feel a little
bit is needed to bootstrap things. The problem is, I found it hard to remain
consistent with this kind of work and so my ability quickly plateaued. I still
ocassionally read textbooks as a bit of light reading - seeing it as extra study - 
but I could never make them part of my dedicated study routine. I see this
practice of "learning at least basic grammar" in popular methods for learning
Japanese, where (depending where you go) people will often direct you to [Tae
Kim's guide for learning
Japanese](https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/category/grammar-guide/). I feel
similarly, so although I didn't stick with textbook work, I can see the value in
at least a bit.

Around the same time I came to this realisation, I stumbled across an [Abroad in
Japan video](https://youtu.be/sspUdoV9Il0) that described a way of learning
Japanese Kanji using what is referred to as "The Heisig Method", coming from the
book "Remembering the Kanji". I discovered that he later adapted these books for
Simplified and Traditional Chinese, as the method for learning Kanji is very similar to Chinese's Hanzi.

The method boils down to the following:
- For each character you want to learn, identify the components of the character.
- If a component is totally new, we have to do the rest of the steps for the component alone.
- Get the full meaning of the character.
- Develop some story that helps you memorise the meaning of the character, given that you know the sub-components of it.

When making the story, the more vivid and weird the better. Associating stories
with concepts is such an amazingly effective memory hack and I think at my peak I had memorised over one thousand characters this way.

The book holds you hand at the start, straight-up giving you stories, though it
encourages you to make your own stories if the baked-in ones aren't your cup of
tea. As you progress, the prompts it provides get increasingly abstract, until
the last section where it simply lists components in the newly introduced
character for your reference.

You may ask that if Chinese is a pictographic language, why not simply make
associations from the appearance of the character to the concept? A
misconception about Chinese is that *every* character has some pictographic
meaning. This is totally false. Apart from the most basic components, most bare
no resemblance.

Yes, 火 kinda looks like a campfire. 森 looks like a bunch of trees, probably a
forest. But how can you associate 挂 with "to hang" from apperance alone? You
can't effectively do that for thousands of characters and that isn't even how
the language developed. However, if you already know the left component means "finger" and the right means "brick", and I tell you the following story:

> An unorthdox way of improving piano playing performance... **hanging**
*bricks* from your *fingers* in order to stretch your fingers, and thus improve
the distance you can span across the piano.

Or how about 达, meaning "to reach".
> Walking along a *road* one day, before a infamous criminal *dog* pulls a gun
and tells you to **reach** for the sky.

Which only makes sense when you see the outermost component as *road* and the intermost as *dog*.

> If you know Chinese, you will know that 大 does not actually mean dog. However,
the book makes a distinction between the meaning of the character as a
*component* and as a full *character*. The book asks you in this case to
memorise 大 as *big*, but when it appears as a component it can take the meaning
*dog* - specifically a *big* Saint Bernard.

I have thousands of stories like this, about three notebooks worth. It is quite
a good creative exercise and taught me a lot about memory, most notably to trust
the process. Your brain is a lot better than you think at memorising things.

Making stories, however, is not enough. The book also introduces you to
spaced-repetition cuecard systems that you review every day in order to truly
ingrain the story and character. The book recommends using paper, though I opted
to use a fantastic piece of software called [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
Though developed for desktop use, it also has phone apps available. Pretty much
whenever I had a moment, I would open the app and do a few reviews.

Though extremely effective of a method, I failed to see the point of it in a
Chinese context. I had assumed that if I learned every character plus basic
grammar, I could somehow read. I had also stored character readings to each
character, with the hope it would also help me memorise pronunciation. Both
assumptions were totally wrong.

Another misconception (that I fell for) about Chinese is that one character is
equal to one word. I feel this is easy to fall for when coming from a European
alphabet. Though some words are indeed made up of one character, most consist of
two or more characters. Furthermore, individual characters can have *multiple*
meanings, as well as pronunciations! Hence, memorising individual characters
will not lead to an understanding of real text.

As you can imagine, this came as a shock to past Alex who had based his entire
understanding off each word being one character. Though a bit crushing, in
retrospect it wasn't a total waste of time. For one, sometimes an individual
character in a word can strongly hint at the full word's meaning. It also serves
as a useful memory aid when learning full words. For example, the word 电池
consists of "electricity" and "pond", which isn't too far off the truth.
Finally, it teaches you a lot about how characters are made up of components and
how to identify and draw them. At my peak, I often joked that my stroke order
was more accurate than a native's, as I was basically writing out hundreds of
characters a day.

Heisig's method is very cool, however I feel it is better to only use it if you
are primarily interested in *writing* Chinese, after you have learned to read
full words. I can't think of a better way to get good at writing without
resorting to mind-numbing rote copying. I don't know if this conclusion applies
to learning Japanese Kanji, as I don't know if multiple Kanji can be combined
into individual words, or if the reading can change. But at least for Chinese,
that is my conclusion.

I'd like to say I came to the above conclusions quickly and pivoted to a
different method, full of vigour. However, this actually put a stop to my
learning for quite some time, feeling I had wasted my time. Eventually though, I
picked myself up, also thanks to the help of my flatmate Wendy from China who was
conveniently training to be a teacher. In exchange for helping her
practice English in a teaching context, she would teach me Chinese, which lasted
until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The teaching there was fairly typical: textbook work, homework, face-to-face
class once per week. Although I said I dislike textbook work, it is more
enjoyable when you have a good teacher who takes the time to prepare deeper
explanations, extra content, and just generally being more strict with me than I
would be on myself. I feel my ability to read and write didn't improve massively
(as I could coast a bit on that fat stack of individual characters I had
memorised), but it was good for my listening and speaking. However, I again
failed to be consistent enough, often forgetting my homework and the like.
Still, thank you Wendy for working me hard.

Not much interesting happened in the early pandemic times apart from a few
scattered attempts. Although for some reason the interest never died and was
eventually resusitated about a year ago. This brings us to what I have been
doing for the past 300 days, and why I think it is working for me.

## The Plan

### Stage One - The Anki Grind

It is often said that when it comes to learning a language, input, input, and
more input is key. Some even claim that input alone is enough. I don't, however
my experiences have led me to believe that it is very high priority. However,
the biggest bottleneck to getting enough real input is to find input that is
comprehensible to you. And what is the biggest bottleneck for comprehensibility?
At least for relatively easier content (up to and including everyday
conversation) I feel the biggest bottleneck is simple lack of knowledge of
vocabulary. Grammar at this point tends to not be incredibly complex and can be
internalised - at least for understanding - from input.

Hence, the first step of the plan is to simply amass a large vocabulary
nowledge. To this end, my old friend Anki will be used heavily. Like before,
everyday I will do my reviews on my phone whenever I have a free moment of time.
However, unlike before I will be using a premade deck of cards, covering the
required vocabulary to pass HSK 1 through 6. It should be said, my goal wasn't
to pass any exams. It was simply to acquire a vast set of vocabulary I can learn
from.

> HSK is the standard language test in China. Since starting this deck, they
rehashed the spec completely, so it now goes beyond 6.

There is a lot of debate between making your own deck and using a premade one.
For building a general foundational vocabulary, I personally feel it is better
to use a premade one. Making your own requires you to be constantly making new
cards, and if you stop making them any day your overall progress will slow. With
a premade deck, I had a constant dripfeed of between 5 and 20 new cards per day,
along with reviews.

This meant I was making guaranteed progress every day. When I was making my own
deck with the Heisig method, there would be periods of time where no new cards
would be added, as it was quite labour intensive to make your own cards.
Additionally, premade decks often come with audio, pictures, example sentences,
and more, which is even more difficult to make. By using a premade deck, I was
saving time and getting some extra practice with listening and reading in
context.

In the past 300 days, I only missed three days of this: one for graduating, one
for moving house, and one from an all-day meeting, free bar combo. This resulted
in a vocabulary of about 2500 words. The latter of which was soul crushing,
which directly inspired me to write this post. 

It is important to emphasise that this is a
*recognition* vocabulary. My *active* vocabulay when speaking or typing is
probably around 1000. Through reading, listening, and speaking practice I hope
to increase this number. However, this mismatch between recognition and active
vocabulary is normal, even in your native language. For example, although I can
recognise the word "subterfuge" I would rarely use it in my own speech. To even
think of an example, I had to search for it online, but once I saw the word I
could recognise it immediately.

In parallel to this, I was also developing my own deck of cuecards. One issue
with a premade deck is that the relevance of the cards shown to you maybe not be
high, depending on the order they appear. For example, in HSK, the word
"basketball" appears nearly a couple thousands word before "vegetables" (HSK1
versus HSK5). Personally, I am much more likely to talk about vegetables than I
am about basketball, but that is just me.

Therefore, developing in parallel my own deck of vocabulary tailored for
me made sense. Whenever I found an interesting word or short phrase, I would add
it to this deck, along with Wavenet text-to-speech audio.

> I've been using the demo key for over 700 cards just try and stop me.

A slight difference to the review format in my own deck is that I would actually
produce two cards: one from Chinese to English and other from English to
Chinese. The idea is, if I found a specific word immediately relevant to me, it
would probably also be worth trying to add it to my *active* vocabulary by using
the English to Chinese card. For the premade, I only used Chinese to English.

I experimented with adding full sentences into the deck, but didn't find it very
effective. For one, the number of mappings between sentences in different
languages increases with sentence length. This made reviewing difficult, as
there was often multiple answers, so it is difficult to be strict when
reviewing. Hence, I limited things to words and short sentences.

Although I am strict about doing reviews every day, I am somewhat relaxed with
the reviews itself. For one, I commit the cardinal Anki sin of using the "Hard"
button. I reserve this for cases where I perhaps remember the meaning, but
forget the reading, or where I truly feel I hadn't fully forgotten, but just had
a momentary lapse. Secondly, I am somewhat aggressive with "suspending" cards in
the premade deck, that I feel are really not relevant at all to me. I would
caution against being too aggressive about this, as some words may be more
common or foundational than you think, however it isn't really worth memorising
some things in this early stage. As it stands, I have approximately 50 cards
suspended, which amounts to about 1% of the whole deck. As a rule of thumb, I
think it is good to learn the first thousand or so in its entireity, and
gradually get more aggressive as you progress.

The final part of this first stage is to begin playing around with the language
a bit. For me, this takes the form of annoying my girlfriend with random words
and phrases I have learned. Though primitive, with basic grammar and a
disproportionately sized vocabulary there is room to have fun. Other examples
include chatting with strangers on apps like HelloTalk and Tandem, keeping a
diary in the target language, and so on. Two of my friends both date Taiwanese
girls, but spend most of their time just insulting each other in Mandarin.
Whatever works for you. I didn't feel the need to stray too much out of my
comfort zone at this stage, just have a bit of fun.

I've heard some people recommend staying in this stage until you get a
vocabulary of around 2000-5000 words. Personally I think it is fine to move on
earlier than that at around 1500, but when isn't really a huge deal. I do want
to emphasize that learning vocabulary like this is suprisingly effective. It can
be argued you are learning words in isolation and hence won't translate well to
full sentences. However, in my experience this isn't the case and has been the
single greatest source of improving my understanding in both reading and
listening. Of course, it doesn't scale infinitely, but I feel it is a good starting point.

### Stage Two - Reading, reading, more reading

At around 1500 words I felt about ready to move on to something else. Still
continuing the Anki grind, I added into the mix a bit of reading every day. If
you have a large enough vocabulary, you will probably find you have outgrown the
beginner text book material, but don't know enough to read more advanced topics.
This intermediate area is quite tough to find material for, but with enough
digging something can be found.

Personally, I quite enjoy using [DUChinese](https://duchinese.net/) (literally,
read chinese) which is an app containing a bunch of short stories and series at
different levels. It includes anything from simple dialogues to tidbits on
culture, to simplified versions of classic stories. It has a limited free
version but I eventually upgraded to their (very fair) subscription to get
access to all stories. Either version also comes with native audio and generally
a really clean UI. It made it quite easy whenever I had time to whip out my
phone and read a little. Generally speaking, the keyword to look for is "graded
reader".

I can't really quantify how much this helped, however it was quite motivating
for me. There was a distinct moment where I was reading a detective story of
about 2000 words and I suddenly realised I was paying more attention to the
story than the language, experiencing feelings of mystery, fear, and disgust at
the content. Yes, to a native the limited vocabulary may make it appear
childlike, but to me it was a really amazing turning point. To be honest, it
showed me just how creative you can be in story telling, even with a limited
vocabulary.

I am not as consistent with daily reading as I am with Anki. I think Anki does a
good job gameifying things and helps you come back. Or maybe I am just addicted
to Github-style heatmaps. However, reading gives a more deeper satisfaction that
I think is useful for getting over the intermediate hump.

### Stage Three - Sentence Mining
At this point, we reach the near present time. I had a realisation that although
my reading ability had improve lots, my listening and speaking was much slower.
This is a natural consequence of focusing mainly on learning vocabulary via
reading, with only a little bit of listening sprinkled in. Furthermore, what
listening I did know was heavily biased towards clean, textbook-style recordings
like those in the cuecards or reading apps. When listening to my girlfriend and
her friends speak, I can only get the general jist or mood of what they are
saying, long after they are finished speaking. It was time to address that.

Sentence mining is the idea of watching or listening to native content that is
mostly understandable to you, searching (or mining) for new words in the content - 
making cuecards as you go. By doing so, you can begin to watch and listen to
native level content and plug holes in your vocabulary as you do so. It sounds
distracting to make cuecards while watching, but if the content is
comprehensible it should not be an incredibly frequent occurence. Furthermore,
if you are watching a movie or multiple things about the same topic, the same
vocabulary tends to repeat. Hence, most of the work is towards the start of the
movie or new topic, as the number of unknown should begin to decrease.

It is analogous to when watching fantasy or sci-fi in your native language when
they introduce totally made up words. Once defined, you do not need constant
reminders about the definition whenever it is referenced later. Your brain
already understands the majority of the words and can focus entirely on the new.

Making cuecards here is much more labour intensive than cards previously
discussed. For one, extracting audio from the content is practically necessary.
Secondly, it is hard to simply use automatic methods like pulling definitions
from a dictionary, as now the meaning of the word is heavily tied to the
surrounding context. This means a greater deal of manual work is required.

Fortunately, there are some tools to help assist here. A popular choice is
[Migaku](https://www.migaku.io/) which hooks into Youtube, Netflix, and the
like, and can even automatically create cuecards. However, it is a payed service and I haven't yet pulled the trigger on it yet. Perhaps as I intensify my sentence mining efforts, I may well do.

In the meantime, I rely on a few three resources. For Netflix, I use [Language
Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/) which handles creating copy-pasteable
subtitles and contextual definitions. I manually record audio and take
screenshots, and add it all to Anki. For Youtube, I have a shoe-stringed
together script that takes in a CSV file of timestamp ranges, sentence
transcription, and word definitions. It then uses
[youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) to download, and ffmpeg to
process it all. I can then import it all into Anki with it's CSV import
functionality. Sometimes I want to mine from audio-only content, in which case
there are no fancy tricks and I just do everything manually. The Anki card
template I use is directly pulled from [Livakivi's
Template](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1757819078). The sentence mining
method itself is also inspired by his [video on sentence
mining](https://www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQBcQJESGQvc&usg=AOvVaw39IlZPA2jUQBR8WsgyCWhZ)
with some extra automation on my part (boy, I love bash scripts). Livakivi
didn't invent the method, but I found his explanation is the most comprehensive
one that I have found.

Although the cuecards include full sentences and audio, I only assess myself on
the specific words I want to learn in the sentence. There is some debate about
this, but personally I feel if the sentences I mined was immediately
comprehensible to me at the time, aside from the target word, I can still
understand it when a review comes up, provided I remembered the target word.
Hence, I don't think it makes sense to review the full sentence.

Like reading, I am nowhere near as consistent as with Anki reviews, which is
again down to how labour intensive it is. I hope to improve this going forward,
but I'll save discussion for this later. After all, this section is about the
past.

## Where am I? Where to go next?
