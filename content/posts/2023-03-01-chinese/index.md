### Title Ideas
270 days of Learning Chinese with Anki.

### Rough Structure
- Introduction
- What did I already know? 
    - How I started
        - Basic grammar
        - Remembering the Simplified Hanzi arc
        - Bits here and there
    - What basis did this give me?
        - Decent understanding of the basic grammar, some basic phrases
        - Good understanding of how to write, remembering individual characters, how to memorise, intro to Anki.
- The plan is simple.
    - What did I plan to do in my current arc?
    - First stage, a giant premade Anki deck + random extra words, try out random texting.
    - Second stage, reading, reading, and more reading.
    - Third stage, sentence mining.
- Where am I now?
    - Pretty good foundations in reading and typing! Can understand written text to a HSK4-5ish level, depending on topic.
    - Better listening and speaking skills, however definitely not enough to be conversational.
    - Lack of confidence speaking, a lot of nerves there. Need to get over it!
- What's next?
    - A much higher emphasis on listening. Starting to sentence mine is good, but the volume needs to be FAR greater (1-2 hours a day at least)
    - Literally going to Taiwan. My listening and speaking is not at a level I predicted I would be at, but I think visiting another country and give me some higher inspiration to go for such a heavy emphasis on listening and speaking, as I am for reading.
- Conclusion
