> A picture of my hand.

Greetings, my name is Alex! I work with AI (primarily deep generative modeling,
unsupervised representation learning, multimodal models), tinker with Linux,
and explore anything else I fancy. In a past life I was a master's student at
Durham University, studying computer science and teaching introductory Python.

Outside of the computer-sphere, I enjoy productively procrastinating by playing
piano and flute. I also have an interest in (slowly) learning languages
(對不起我只會說一點中文。。)

I'm using this site to document and consolidate my learning and to highlight
any interesting projects I'm working on. If you notice any mistakes or just
want to chat feel free to reach out!
