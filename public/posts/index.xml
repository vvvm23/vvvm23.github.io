      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a hankering for a while to completely redo my personal website. There are a number of reasons for this:
For one, the old site was generated using my own static site generator sss. This was more of a project to learn Rust, rather than a project to build a static site generator. As such, it has not stood the test of time. Most notably, adding new features is truly awful and the HTML templates are part of the source code, rather than being separate and thus easily customisable.</description>
