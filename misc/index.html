I enjoy learning Mandarin Chinese very slowly. My reading and typing is much
stronger than my listening and speaking, but working on addressing that. I&rsquo;ve
been studying on and off for about five years, but wouldn&rsquo;t say I got serious
until about two years ago. I started with learning simplified characters but
now I am focusing more and more on learning traditional characters.
I use Whisper to help me learn, through a process called sentence mining. You
can find my current, crappy code for this
here and learn more about sentence mining
through this great video. I
